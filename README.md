# Neovim configuration for Java, Python, Rust and Lua

This is my personal LUA based configuration for Neovim that I use on a daily basis as Java, Python and RUST IDE. This setup is the product of continuous enhancements based in what I have found in configurations shared by other users. It is an ongoing project that may evolve with time as I come accross with new plugins, refine mappings or refactor configuration files.<br>Feel free to fork this repository and adapt it to your own needs.

# Installation
## Manual Setup
0. Install latest [NeoVIM version](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim). 
1. Clone this repository into `~/.config/nvim`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/magidc/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) into your OS. It is required by some [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin searching modes.

3. This environment is configured with Language Server Providers (LSP) for Java, Python, Rust and Lua. All of them are integrated with Neovim native LSP support. It is required to install LSP in your system in order to have IDE features like autocompletions or error highlight. To facilitate installation of LSPs this configuration relies on [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim#installation) plugin. Find below the instructions to setup each one of the supported LSPs:
   1. **Java**: Run `:MasonInstall jdtls` to download LSP. Make also sure to set the `java_cmd` path in the jdlts config file and change "HOME" to "USERPROFILE"!!
   2. **Rust**: Run `:MasonInstall rust_analyzer` to download LSP.
   3. **Lua**: Run `:MasonInstall lua-language-server` to download LSP.
   4. **Python**: Run `:MasonInstall pyright` to download LSP.

# UI theme
Several UI themes are preconfigured in this setup. Active theme is set by editing file `lua/settings.lua`.
Default active theme is [Onedark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim).

<br>

# Custom mappings
Most of mappings are defined in file `lua/mappings.lua`. WhichKey plugin is used in order to provide a description for each one of them.
Other mappings can be found in specific plugin configuration files in `lua/plugins/configs` directory.

<br>

# Equivalent mapping configurations for other IDEs VIM integrations
I have created configuration files with (almost) equivalent mappings for [Eclipse IDE vim plugin (vrapper)](https://github.com/magidc/dotfiles/blob/master/.vrapperrc), [IntelliJ vim plugin (ideaVim)](https://github.com/magidc/dotfiles/blob/master/.ideavimrc) and [VIM (.vimrc)](https://github.com/magidc/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).
For VSCode VIM plugin I set the option to use .vimrc config file.
These configurations will allow users who are used to these key combinations to remain confortable and efficient while working with other IDEs.

# Contributing
By the moment, free contribution is not allowed. I consider this setup to be on its early stages so it requires to be more mature before opening to other users. However I would appreciate suggestions.
